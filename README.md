VLSMwithANTs
============
This is an example on how you can run VLSM in R using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).
The instructions are included as comments in the file https://github.com/dorianps/VLSMwithANTs/blob/master/VLSM_example.sh

Files available:
VLSM_example.sh - the code to run everything
Lesions.tar.gz - lesions already drawn for each subject
VLSM_folder.tar.gz - lesions normalized and ready for VLSM + template image to overlay results


Good luck!
